title: Attitude and heading reference system
summary: Calculated acceleration, angular velocity and height for optimum payload deployment using accelerometer (ADXL345), gyroscope (L3g4200d0) and barometer (BMP085) of a make-shift rocket. Used a compass made with a magnetometer (HMC5883L) to determine the heading.
