title: Vehicle Tracking and Detection
summary: Trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) toidentify car and non-car images.  Used windows of different sizes across frames of video (smaller windowsto detect cars far away and larger windows to detect closer ones) as input to classifier to detect the carsin the video.  Used thresholds based on confidence of classification of the SVM to remove false positives.
